# Dockerized .NET API with GitHub Actions CI/CD

This is a basic **ASP.NET Core Web API** project that has been **Dockerized** and configured with **CI/CD using GitHub Actions**. When changes are pushed to the repository, the API is automatically built and deployed.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Basic ASP.NET Core Web API.
- Docker containerization for easy deployment.
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Automatic deployment on push.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **.NET 8.0** â€“ Web API framework.
- **Docker** â€“ Containerization.
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ CI/CD automation.
- **Railway** (or another deployment platform).

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Run Locally

To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abulfez/dockerized-api.git
    cd dockerized-api
    ```

2. Build and run using Docker:
    ```bash
    docker build -t dockerized-api .
    docker run -p 8080:8080 dockerized-api
    ```

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Workflow

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation.  
Each time you push changes to the repository:

1. GitHub Actions runs the pipeline.
2. The API is built and tested.
3. The Docker image is created and pushed to a container registry (if configured).
4. The application is deployed automatically.
